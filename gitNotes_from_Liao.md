## Introduction
- **Git** is a distributed version control system.
- **SVN** vs **Git**, Centralized or Distributed?  
  - **SVN** has a central repository to store all files and historical data.  
  **Git** has a central repository as well as a series of local repositories. Local repositories are exact copies of the central repository complete with the entire history of changes.

  - **SVN** developers commit their changes directly to that central server repository. Offline access is limited.  
  **Git** developers work on their local repositories and then merge into the central repository, allowing them to continue working without losing features if they lose conncetion.

  - **SVN** may have a single point of failure. If there is an error, it can destory all builds. When the central repository is broken, developers have to wait until the central repository is fixed.  
  **Git** developers can continue to commit code locally until the central repository is fixed.
## Git Commands
### Git Configuration
```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```
The parameter `--global` indicates all repositories in this PC will share the same configuration.
### Build a repository
#### Initialization
```bash
$ git init
```
#### Add files to a repository
```bash
$ git add <file>
$ git commit -m "description"
```
You can use `git add` multiple times to track multiple files, and then use `git commit` to add all changes to the repository. The parameter `-m` indicates comments for this commit.

### Check Working directory
```bash
$ git status
```
### Check changes
```bash
$ git diff
```
```bash
$ git diff --cached
```
```bash
$ git diff HEAD -- <file>
```
- `git diff` check difference between _**work dir**_ and _**stage**_
- `git diff --cached` check difference between _**stage**_ and _**branch**_(current)
- `git diff HEAD -- <file>` check difference between _**work dir**_ and _**branch**_ (HEAD points at the latest commit of the current branch)
### Check log information
```bash
$ git log --oneline --decorate --stat
```
- `--oneline` equals `--pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit`
- `--decorate` shows details about the branches and HEAD
- `--stat` shows brief information of insertion and deletion
### Check command log
```bash
$ git reflog
```
### Version rollback
```bash
$ git reset --soft/mixed/hard HEAD/HEAD^/HEAD^^/HEAD~100/commit_id/id_prefix
```
- `--soft` indicates no touching of _**work dic**_ or _**index(stage)**_ files, resetting **HEAD** to _<commit_id>_
- `--mixed`(default) indicates no touching of _**work dic**_ files, resetting _**index**_ and **HEAD** to _<commit_id>_
- `--hard` indicates resetting **ALL** things to _<commit_id>_ which means discarding all changes

`HEAD` points at the current version, `HEAD^` points at the previous version, `HEAD^^` points at the second previous version, `HEAD~100` points at the 100th previous version. We can also rollback to the certain version via commit id which can be obtained by `git log`.

### Discard changes(modification, removal)
#### Discard changes in work dir
```bash
$ git checkout -- <file>
```
Rollback the file to the latest `git add` or `git commit`

#### Discard changes in stage
Step 1: Discard changes in _**stage**_
```bash
$ git reset HEAD <file>
```
Step 2: Discard changes in _**work dir**_
```bash
$ git checkout -- <file>
```
Tip:
```bash
$ git reset --hard HEAD <file>
```
This is a combination of Step 1 and Step 2.

### Remove files
```bash
$ git rm <file>
```
`git rm <file>` equals
```bash
$ rm <file>
$ git add <file>
```
### Remote repository
#### Generate SSH Key
```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "youremail@example.com"
```
#### Add a remote repository
```bash
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repositoryname.git
& git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repositoryname.git
```
#### Push to a remote repository
```bash
$ git push -u origin master
```
`-u` indicates the first push of all files. `git push origin master` for the following push.

#### Clone from a remote repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/usern/repositoryname.git
```
Clone a whole project
```bash
$ svn https://github.com/xx/xxx
```
Clone a directory. Note: replace 'tree' with 'branch' of the URL
```bash
$ wget https://raw.github.com/xxx/xxx/xxx
```
Clone a single file. Note: use the URL of raw data

### Branch
#### Create a branch
```bash
$ git branch <branchname>
```
#### Check branches
```bash
$ git branch
```
`git branch` list all branches, attaching * at the current branch

#### Switch branches
```bash
$ git checkout <branchname>
```

#### Create + Switch a branch
```bash
$ git checkout -b <branchname>
```

#### Merge a branch to the current branch
```bash
$ git merge <branchname>
```

#### Delete a branch
```bash
$ git branch -d <branchname>
```
#### Check graph log about branches
```bash
$ git log --graph
```

#### No-fast-forward merge
```bash
$ git merge --no-ff -m "description" <branchname>
```
`--no-ff` indicates merging branches by generating another commitï¼Œin which case a comment is needed.

#### Save the current work
```bash
$ git stash
```
#### Check saved work
```bash
$ git stash list
```
#### Recover saved work
```bash
$ git stash pop
```
#### Discard a branch which is never merged with parameter `-D`
```bash
$ git branch -D <branchname>
```

#### Check the remote repository
```bash
$ git remote -v
```

#### Create a local branch corresponding to the remote branch
```bash
$ git checkout -b branch-name origin/branch-name
```
It is better for two branches to share a same name.

#### Add a connection between the local and remote branches
```bash
$ git branch --set-upstream branch-name origin/branch-name
```
